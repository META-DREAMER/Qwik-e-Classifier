# Create the file "fpga.bin" with board-specific programming files.
# At host program runtime, when the device needs to be reprogrammed
# an in-memory buffer with the contents of this "fpga.bin" file will be
# given to the board-specific communication layer.
# The memory buffer will be aligned to 128 bytes.
#
# This script expects one file argument:
#  The second is the name of the RBF file, typically "top.rbf"

# In this flow we create an ELF-formatted file with two sections.
# Section ".acl.rbf" contains the contents of the RBF file.
# Both secitons are aligned to 128 bytes.
