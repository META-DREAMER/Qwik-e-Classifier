//! Currently does very little other than print a possible location for
//! OpenCL.lib.
//!
//! Something needs to be done with this to allow it to actually search for
//! and link either OpenCL.lib or OpenCL.dll (depending on gnu/msvc
//! toolchain).


/*
 * This build script needs your help!
 *
 * To get cl-sys working on _all_ platforms will be a group effort.
 * Namely GPU's are ungodly expensive. I don't know where _every_
 * OpenCL.lib file is installed to on Windows.
 *
 * So if you want to use this library on windows. Please patch in your
 * OpenCL.lib location.
 *
 * You will need to install the OpenCL SDK for your _vendor_
 *
 * In the future we _may_ want to add feature flag to determine _which_ vendor's OpenCL you are
 * using.
