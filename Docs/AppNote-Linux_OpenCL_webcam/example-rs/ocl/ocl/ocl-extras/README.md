## ocl-extras

Types and components used in examples and tests within the
[ocl](https://github.com/cogciprocate/ocl) library but that may be useful for
others to use within their own projects.

Please contribute your improvements and additions! If you have a variation on
one of the types within, give it a new name and submit a pull request.
