Intel(R) FPGA Cyclone V SoC Runtime Environment for OpenCL(TM) Release 17.1 README.TXT
===========================================================================
 
This README.txt file accompanies the Intel(R) FPGA Cyclone(R) V SoC Runtime
Environment (RTE) for OpenCL(TM) version 17.1.

OpenCL and the OpenCL logo are trademarks of Apple Inc., used by
permission of the Khronos Group(TM).

The RTE is a companion to the Intel(R) FPGA Software Development Kit (SDK) for
OpenCL(TM) of the same version. The RTE supports a subset of the features
available in the SDK.  Use this RTE to compile and execute host programs
in a Cyclone V SoC Linux environment.

IMPORTANT: You must compile OpenCL device programs with the Intel(R) FPGA SDK
for OpenCL(TM) of the same version.

This version of the RTE is an implementation of the Khronos
OpenCL Specification version 1.0, and it passes the Khronos OpenCL
Conformance Testing Process. Current conformance status can be found
at http://www.khronos.org/conformance.

Please refer to the Intel(R) FPGA RTE for OpenCL(TM) Getting Started Guide and
the Intel(R) FPGA SDK for OpenCL(TM) Programming Guide for a summary of supported
features.

Although we have made every effort to ensure that this version of
the Intel(R) FPGA RTE for OpenCL(TM) software functions correctly, there might be
problems that we have not encountered. If you have a question or problem
that is not answered by the information provided in the documentation,
please contact Altera support at 1-800-800-EPLD, or submit a service
request at mysupport.altera.com.
