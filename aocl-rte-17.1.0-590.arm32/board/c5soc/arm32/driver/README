Intel(R) OpenCL SoC Driver for Linux
------------------------------------------

This directory contains full source code for the Intel(R) OpenCL 
SoC Driver for Linux on ARM [1][2].  


PREREQUISITES
-------------
Cross-compiler installed

COMPIILE and INSTALL
--------------------

To compile the driver, first modify the KDIR variable in Makefile
to point to Linux kernel source files that came with SoC EDS installation.
Then run 'make' as regular user. The compiled driver file will be named
aclsoc_drv.ko.

To load the compiled driver:
  insmod aclsoc_drv.ko
  
(The driver must be loaded to run host programs AND to reprogram 
the device).

To quickly test if the driver and the FPGA work
  aocl diagnostic

To reprogram the FPGA core from within ARM, load the driver and run
  aocl program /dev/acl0 <aocx_filename>

To unload the driver:
  rmmod aclsoc_drv
